# "Come unto me... I will give thee rest." ~Matthew 11:28

Our Stake President, Richard Platt, gave the opening remarks. President Platt began with a story about a family in Greece. The children were grown and the father had passed away a time before. One night the father came in a dream to the mother asking, "Where is my white suit?" Time passed and the children were introduced to the gospel, and eventually performed baptism and endowment for the father. He, again, returned in the dream to his wife, this time wearing the white suit. His wife asked where it came from and he said, "My children got it for me." 

Following this story President Platt told a story about a missionary called to Greece on his mission. There were problems with his Visa and he was sent to another mission in the United States while he waited for the problems to be resolved. While there, he met a woman with a non-member husband who was Greek. He asked the man to help him practice the discussions in Greek and the man agreed. After hearing all of the discussions, the man asked to be baptized. The missionary left just a couple of days later.

At the end of his talk President Platt declared his testimony, promising to us that, "If we come unto \[Christ], we will find peace and rest."
